### Prdict Resolution_set for Technical tickets in an organization

#### Blurb:

This project is to explore and analyze the Problem-Abstracts from tickets reported by clients/customers.
customer/clients raise tickets whenever they have issues or interruptions in service offered through various applications/systems across organization.
Each Ticket has a "Problem-Abstract" that explains about the technical issue faced by customer. Based on Technical issue, these tickets need to be routed to concerned teams for fixing issues. Each fix provided by technician has a "Resolution_set" associated with it based on root_cause of the issue.

Our Aim is to train a model that reads the problem abstract from customer and predict resolution_set name for each ticket before routing to a technician. This will help reducing delays in routing the tickets from one team to other, reduce the time for identifying the root_cause and enables faster resolution of the issues.

Expected Accuracy levels of Prediction Equation is to be decided.
