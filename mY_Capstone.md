### Breast Cancer Detection
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29


#### Blurb:

This project is to train an alogorithm to predict "Diagnosis" result of given case from readings generated in Breat Cancer screening. Data includes 32 features of real-world dignostics of "Breast Cancer" tests. 

Expected Accuracy levels of algorithm is to be decided.

###### Features / Attributes information:
Number of attributes: 32 (ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

### Predicting the outcomes of Basket ball tornament
https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017


#### Blurb:

This is project is to train an algorithm to predict the outcomes (winners and losers) of US men's college basketball tournament using rich historical data.

Expected Accuracy levels of Prediction Equation is to be decided.

###### Data information:

* Teams
This file identifies the different college teams present in the dataset. Each team has a 4 digit id number.

* Seasons:
This file identifies the different seasons included in the historical data, along with certain season-level properties.

* RegularSeasonCompactResults
This file identifies the game-by-game results for 32 seasons of historical data, from 1985 to 2015. Each year, it includes all games played from daynum 0 through 132 (which by definition is "Selection Sunday," the day that tournament pairings are announced). Each row in the file represents a single game played.

* RegularSeasonDetailedResults
This file is a more detailed set of game results, covering seasons 2003-2016. This includes team-level total statistics for each game (total field goals attempted, offensive rebounds, etc.) The column names should be self-explanatory to basketball fans (as above, "w" or "l" refers to the winning or losing team):

* TourneyCompactResults
This file identifies the game-by-game NCAA tournament results for all seasons of historical data. The data is formatted exactly like the regular_season_compact_results.csv data. Note that these games also include the play-in games (which always occurred on day 134/135) for those years that had play-in games.

* TourneyDetailedResults
This file contains the more detailed results for tournament games from 2003 onward.

* TourneySeeds
This file identifies the seeds for all teams in each NCAA tournament, for all seasons of historical data. Thus, there are between 64-68 rows for each year, depending on the bracket structure.

* TourneySlots
This file identifies the mechanism by which teams are paired against each other, depending upon their seeds. Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. If there were N teams in the tournament during a particular year, there were N-1 teams eliminated (leaving one champion) and therefore N-1 games played, as well as N-1 slots in the tournament bracket, and thus there will be N-1 records in this file for that season.
